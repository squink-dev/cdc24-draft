Let another guide the way, In the game, let others sway.  The honor's grand, the stakes are high, But in my heart, a simple sigh. To step aside, to find my peace, Let my spirit find release.  Underneath the northern sky, I'll watch the game and wonder why. For now, I choose the quiet stream, And let another chase the dream.  Alas, I wish a simple life. One where my chance of captain is low and my spirits high. "
